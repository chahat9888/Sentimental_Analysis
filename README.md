# Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using Naive Bayes

This project analyzes customer reviews to classify them as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using a Naive Bayes classifier.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF
- Google Colab

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset used: Kaggle product reviews (e.g., Amazon or Flipkart)

## 🔧 Steps Followed
1. Data Cleaning (Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming)
2. TF-IDF Vectorization
3. Naive Bayes Model Training
4. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix

## 📁 Files
- `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Main code notebook
- `dataset.csv`: Review dataset
